# Advent of CSS 2024

## Challenge 1 - Photo Gallery

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Here is a photo gallery with conditional layouts that depend on the number of photos. If the gallery has more than 5 photos, it will keep the current layout and let the user know more photos exist with a numerical display. 

Original challenge site from Amy Dutton [here](https://www.adventofcss.com/).

## Approach

A final webpage showing the layout for one photo is shown [here](https://myrojoylee.github.io/aoc-2024-challenge-1/).

Demo below rotating between different layouts:

## Notes/Improvements

Since it is a CSS challenge, there were limitations to conditional layouts. Should there be an opportunity to modify this using JS, the code could be improved instead of using pseudo-classes.
