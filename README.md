## Challenge 1 - Photo Gallery

Here is a photo gallery with conditional layouts that depend on the number of photos. If the gallery has more than 5 photos, it will keep the current layout and let the user know more photos exist with a numerical display. 

## Approach

A final webpage showing the layout for five or more photos is shown [here]().

Demo below showing different layouts:

## Notes/Improvements

Since it is a CSS challenge, there were limitations to conditional layouts. Should there be an opportunity to modify this using JS, the code could be improved instead of using pseudo-classes.
